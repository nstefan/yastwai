# Agent Specification - Core

This is the language-agnostic core specification for AI coding agents. Load this file alongside the appropriate language overlay for your project (e.g., `swift.md`, `python.md`, `typescript.md`).

---

## 0. Orientation

### 0a. Project Purpose

YASTwAI (Yet Another Subtitle Translator with AI) is an async Rust CLI application that extracts subtitles from video files and translates them using multiple AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic). It preserves formatting, timing, and context-awareness with session persistence and caching.

```

### 0c. Key Files Map

Do not hardcode file paths here. Instead, describe what agents should search for:

- **Entry point**: Search for `main`, `index`, `app`, or `Application` in filenames
- **Configuration**: Search for config files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`) in root
- **Dependencies**: Search for package manifests (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `Project.swift`, etc.)
- **Build scripts**: Search for `Makefile`, `build.sh`, or build tool configs

### 0d. Architecture Patterns

- **Provider Pattern**: Trait-based AI provider interface for extensibility
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Multi-pass translation with analysis, translation, and validation passes
- **Repository Pattern**: Database abstraction layer with SQLite
- **Context Window Management**: Sliding window with glossary and scene tracking

---

## 1. Goals

Specify WHAT to achieve, not HOW. Agents discover execution methods by exploring the project.

### 1.1 Build Goal

**Objective**: Compile or bundle the project successfully with zero errors.

**Discovery**: Search for build tool configs, package manifests, or Makefiles. Common patterns:
- Node.js: `package.json` scripts
- Rust: `Cargo.toml`
- Go: `go.mod`
- Swift/iOS: `Project.swift`, `*.xcworkspace`, `*.xcodeproj`
- Python: `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`

### 1.2 Test Goal

**Objective**: Run the test suite and ensure all tests pass.

**Discovery**: Search for test directories (`test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`) and test configuration files.

### 1.3 Lint Goal

**Objective**: Ensure code passes style and quality checks.

**Discovery**: Search for linter configs (`.eslintrc`, `rustfmt.toml`, `.swiftlint.yml`, `pyproject.toml`).

### 1.4 Run Goal

**Objective**: Execute the application locally for verification.

**Discovery**: Search for run scripts, entry points, or development server configs.

## 2. Code Style Principles

### 2.1 General Conventions

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns, but only when there are 3+ instances
- **SOLID Principles**: Favor single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Prefer obvious solutions over clever ones
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build for hypothetical future requirements

### 2.2 Naming Philosophy

- Names should reveal intent without requiring comments
- Use domain vocabulary consistently throughout the codebase
- Prefer explicit, descriptive names over short abbreviations
- Search existing code to match project naming conventions before creating new names

### 2.3 File Organization Principles

- One primary concept per file (class, module, component)
- Group by feature or domain, not by type (unless project convention differs)
- Related types may coexist in the same file if tightly coupled
- Search for existing patterns before deciding on organization

### 2.4 Comment Policy

- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT (the code shows what)
- Delete commented-out code; version control preserves history
- Do not add docstrings or comments to code you didn't modify

---

## 3. Git Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Strategy

- **main/master**: Production-ready code
- **Feature branches**: Created for specific tasks
- Discover project-specific branch naming by examining recent branches: `git branch -r`

### 3.2 Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Guidelines**:
- Keep commits small and focused on a single change
- Each commit should leave the codebase in a working state
- Write clear, descriptive messages in imperative mood

### 3.3 PR Requirements

- Descriptive title summarizing the change
- Body explaining WHAT changed and WHY
- Reference related issues if applicable
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review

### 3.4 Review Expectations

- Address all review comments before merging
- Explain reasoning when disagreeing with feedback
- Keep discussion focused on the code, not the person

---

## 4. Testing Philosophy

### 4.1 Test Coverage Expectations

- New features require corresponding tests
- Bug fixes require regression tests
- Critical paths should have high coverage
- Do not delete tests or reduce coverage without explicit approval

### 4.2 Test Organization Principles

- Test files mirror source file structure
- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Discover project test structure by exploring existing tests

### 4.3 What to Test vs. What Not To

**Test**:
- Business logic and core algorithms
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Integration points with external systems
- Public API contracts

**Skip**:
- Framework internals (trust the framework)
- Simple getters/setters with no logic
- Third-party library behavior

---

## 5. Engineering Preferences

### 5.1 Simplicity Over Compatibility

- Make the simplest change possible
- Don't add migration paths, backwards-compatibility shims, or deprecation layers
- Delete old code, rename freely, refactor aggressively
- Avoid `_unused` variable renames; just remove unused code

### 5.2 Readability Over Cleverness

- Code should be obvious to the next reader
- Prefer larger, clearer changes over minimal but obscure ones
- If a bigger refactor makes code more readable, do it
- Avoid clever one-liners that require mental gymnastics to understand

### 5.3 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Over-engineering**: Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- **Premature abstraction**: Three similar lines are better than one premature helper
- **Defensive programming for impossible scenarios**: Only validate at system boundaries
- **Future-proofing**: Don't design for hypothetical requirements
- **Gold plating**: A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up

---

## 6. Planning & Documentation

> **IMPORTANT**: These planning rules override any tool-specific planning features (e.g., Claude Code's built-in plan mode, Cursor's planning, etc.). Always use the project's `plans/TEMPLATE.md` format.

### 6.1 Plan File Format

When asked to plan, create a file in `plans/YYYYMMDD-topic.md` using the template from `plans/TEMPLATE.md`.

**Required sections** (see `plans/TEMPLATE.md` for full template):

```markdown
# Plan: <Title>

Filename: plans/YYYYMMDD-topic.md

## Context
- <one-line goal>
- <constraints/assumptions>

## Interfaces
- <protocol or interface name>
  - <method signature + responsibility>

## Steps
1. [ ] <step>
2. [ ] <step>

## Implementation State
- State: not-started | in-progress | blocked | done
- Current step: <step number + title>
- Last updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Dependencies
- <internal/external dependencies>

## Migration And Rollback
- <migration steps>
- <rollback plan>

## Testing
- <unit/integration tests>

## Risks
- <risk and mitigation>
```

**Additional sections** (include when relevant): Status Updates, Checkpoints, Performance Budget, Rollout, Observability, Open Questions.

### 6.2 Progress Tracking Protocol

- Mark steps complete (`[x]`) as they finish
- Update "Current step" when starting new work
- Add commit hashes after each commit
- Document blockers or deviations from the plan

**Commit-Hash Loop Prevention**:
1. Commit implementation changes first (without hash in plan)
2. Update plan with commit hash as a separate commit
3. Never amend after updating plan with hash

### 6.3 Handoff Context Requirements

When transitioning between sessions or agents:
- Summarize what was accomplished
- List artifacts created or modified
- Describe next steps clearly
- Include relevant code snippets or error messages

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Principles

### 7.1 Debug Strategy

1. **Reproduce first**: Confirm you can trigger the issue
2. **Read error messages**: They often point directly to the problem
3. **Check recent changes**: What changed since it last worked?
4. **Isolate the problem**: Binary search through code or commits
5. **Search existing issues**: The problem may already be documented

### 7.2 Common Issue Patterns

- **Build failures**: Check dependency versions, clean build artifacts, regenerate project
- **Test failures**: Run tests in isolation to find interference
- **Type errors**: Check for mismatched interfaces or missing imports
- **Runtime errors**: Add logging to trace execution flow

---

## 8. Skills Discovery

> **Agents should proactively suggest relevant skills** from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) based on project technologies.

### 8.1 When to Suggest Skills

Suggest skills during:
- **Initial project setup** or first interaction with a codebase
- **New feature implementation** that matches a skill's domain
- **User asks about best practices** for a technology with available skills

### 8.2 Detection Protocol

1. **Scan project files** to detect technologies:
   - `package.json` → Check dependencies for React, Vue, Expo, etc.
   - `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Package.swift` → Language detection
   - Config files → `tailwind.config.*`, `next.config.*`, etc.

2. **Consult registry**: Check `agents/skills-registry.md` for matching skills

3. **Check installed**: Look for existing `.skills/` directory or registry markers

4. **Suggest relevant skills** not yet installed

### 8.3 Suggestion Format

```
I noticed this is a [technology] project. These skills could help:

**[Skill Name]** - [What it provides]
→ `npx skills add [owner/repo]`

Would you like me to install any of these?
```

### 8.4 Installation

With user approval:
```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo>
```

Track installed skills in `agents/skills-registry.md` under "Installed Skills".

### 8.5 Skill Resources

- **Browse skills**: https://skills.sh
- **Registry file**: `agents/skills-registry.md`
- **Create skills**: `npx skills init <name>`

## 99999. Boundaries (CRITICAL)

This section defines what agents may and may not do. Higher section numbers indicate higher criticality.

### Always Safe

- Read any file in the project
- Run build, test, and lint commands discovered from the project
- Modify source files in designated source directories
- Add new files following existing patterns
- Run read-only git commands (`status`, `diff`, `log`)
- Create commits with descriptive messages
- Push to feature branches

### Ask First

- Modify build configuration or dependency manifests
- Create new modules or major architectural components
- Change database schemas or data models
- Modify security-related code (authentication, encryption, access control)
- Add new external dependencies
- Delete files or remove functionality
- Push to main/master branch
- Force push or rewrite git history

### Never Do

- Expose secrets, API keys, or credentials in code
- Commit sensitive files (`.env`, credentials, private keys)
- Disable security features or sandbox protections
- Delete tests or reduce test coverage without approval
- Execute destructive commands on production systems
- Modify files outside the project directory
- Run commands that could affect system stability
- Ignore explicit user instructions about what not to do
