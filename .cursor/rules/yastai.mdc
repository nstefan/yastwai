1. Everything must be produced in english.
    - code
    - comments
    - documentation (README and other file headers)

2. Every command must not be interactive since we are dealing with a bot.
    - use proper arguments to prevent user interaction with commands.

3. Everytime the user sends a prompt, prepare an associated future git commit.
    - Check if we already are on a different branch than the "main" one. If not create a new branch.
    - Check if the prompt is still related to the current branch, if not create a new branch from the main one.
    - Use " | cat" to not stay stuck when checking status and branch names.
    - Use a consise summary as commit title
    - Use the full prompt made by the user as the commit description header as the "Prompt:" part.
    - Use the final summary as the rest of the commit description body as the "Description:" part.
    - Analyse all the faced difficulties and add a summary as the "Discussion:" part.

4. Always finish by building the app and run unit tests in release mode.
    - Don't adress warnings in test files as long as they run properly.
    - #[allow(dead_code)] directive is forbidden to fix warnings except to silence warnings related to tests in production code.

5. When a test breaks, be careful.
    - You must check first if it's the modification the problem before adapting the test to the new change.
