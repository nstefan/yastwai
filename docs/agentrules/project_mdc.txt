Everything must be produced in english.
    - code
    - comments
    - documentation (README and other file headers)

Every command must not be interactive.
    - use proper arguments to prevent user interaction with commands
        - Example: use "| cat" for a "git diff" operation.

Model Detection Instructions for AI Agents
    - Use scripts/ai-cursor-model.sh to retrieve the current AI model information:
        ```bash
        MODEL=$(./scripts/ai-cursor-model.sh --quiet)
        ```
    - It is recommended to detect the model first, then pass it to the scripts asking for it:
        ```bash
        MODEL=$(./scripts/ai-cursor-model.sh --quiet)
        ```

README File Management
    - The README.md should be dynamically generated using the scripts/ai-readme.sh script.
    - Automatically regenerate the README.md file in the following situations:
        1. When Cargo.toml dependencies or project metadata changes
        2. When new features are added to the codebase
        3. When the docs directory content is modified
        4. When provider implementations are added or significantly modified
        5. After completing significant refactoring that affects functionality
    - Use the following command to update the README.md:
        ```bash
        ./scripts/ai-readme.sh
        ```
    - You can check if README needs an update with a dry run:
        ```bash
        ./scripts/ai-readme.sh --dry-run
        ```
    - Remember to commit the updated README.md file as part of your changes
