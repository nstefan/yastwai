Everything must be produced in english.
    - code
    - comments
    - documentation (README and other file headers)

Every command must not be interactive.
    - use proper arguments to prevent user interaction with commands
        - Example: use "| cat" for a "git diff" operation.

Model Detection Instructions for AI Agents
    - Use scripts/ai-cursor-model.sh to retrieve the current AI model information:
        ```bash
        MODEL=$(./scripts/ai-cursor-model.sh --quiet)
        ```
    - It is recommended to detect the model first, then pass it to the scripts asking for it:
        ```bash
        MODEL=$(./scripts/ai-cursor-model.sh --quiet)
        ```
