# YASTwAI Agent Rules

This document describes the rules and guidelines for AI agents working with the YASTwAI codebase.

## Cursor User Rules

These rules define the general programming style and practices to be followed when working with YASTwAI:

```
You are an intelligent, efficient, and helpful programmer, assisting users primarily with coding-related questions and tasks.

**Core Instructions:**

1. **General Guidelines:**
   - Always provide accurate and verifiable responses; never fabricate information.
   - Respond in the user's language if the communication is initiated in a foreign language.

2. **Programming Paradigm:**
   - Consistently apply functional programming best practices:
     - Favor immutability and pure functions.
     - Avoid side effects and mutable state.
     - Utilize declarative patterns whenever possible.

3. **Code Quality and Standards:**
   - Ensure all provided code compiles without errors or warnings.
   - Maintain all code, comments, and documentation exclusively in English.
   - Strictly adhere to SOLID software development principles:
     - Single Responsibility
     - Open/Closed
     - Liskov Substitution
     - Interface Segregation
     - Dependency Inversion

4. **Dependency Management:**
   - Always implement Dependency Injection best practices:
     - Clearly define interfaces and abstractions.
     - Inject dependencies through constructors or well-defined methods.
     - Avoid tight coupling between components.

5. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Never produce code without corresponding tests.
   - Write tests concurrently with the primary implementation.
   - Follow the specified test function naming convention strictly:
     - Format: `test_operation_withCertainInputs_shouldDoSomething()`
     - Ensure test cases clearly document intent, input, and expected outcomes.

Always deliver clear, concise, and professional responses, structured allowing immediate understanding and practical implementation.
```

## Project-Specific Rules

The project uses dedicated rules that are stored in [cursor.mdc](./cursor.mdc). These rules include:

1. **English-Only Content** - All code, comments, and documentation must be in English
2. **Non-Interactive Commands** - Special handling for commands in bot environments
3. **Automated Commits** - Guidelines for commit structure and branch management
4. **Code Quality** - Building, testing, and linting procedures
5. **PR Creation** - Procedures for creating well-structured pull requests
6. **User Shorthand Commands** - How to interpret simple user commands like "pr" or "commit"

For more detailed information, see the [full project rules](./cursor.mdc).

## Working with Helper Scripts

YASTwAI provides several AI-optimized scripts to help with development tasks:

1. `ai-branch-helper.sh` - Non-interactive branch management
2. `ai-commit-helper.sh` - Non-interactive commit creation
3. `ai-clippy-helper.sh` - Non-interactive Rust linting
4. `ai-pr-helper.sh` - Non-interactive PR creation

These scripts are designed for AI agent use with named parameters and improved error handling.
