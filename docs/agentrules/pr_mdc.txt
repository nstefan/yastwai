Pull requests creation instructions, ONLY create PRs when EXPLICITLY requested by the user.
    - NEVER create a PR automatically or as part of another task unless directly requested.
    - ALWAYS use the scripts/ai-pr.sh script as the preferred method for PR creation on Unix/macOS. On Windows, use the PowerShell equivalent:
      - Unix/macOS: `./scripts/ai-pr.sh --title "PR Title" --overview "..." --model "cursor-gpt-5"`
      - Windows (PowerShell): `pwsh -File scripts/ai-pr.ps1 --title "PR Title" --overview "..." --model "cursor-gpt-5"`
      - Windows (CMD shim): `scripts\\ai-pr.cmd --title "PR Title" --overview "..." --model "cursor-gpt-5"`
    - The helper script avoids multiline command issues and creates well-structured PRs:
        ```bash
        ./scripts/ai-pr.sh --title "PR Title" --overview "Brief overview" --key-changes "Change 1,Change 2" --implementation "Detail 1,Detail 2"
        # Windows
        pwsh -File scripts/ai-pr.ps1 --title "PR Title" --overview "Brief overview" --key-changes "Change 1,Change 2" --implementation "Detail 1,Detail 2" --model "cursor-gpt-5"
        ```
    - Use the `--draft` option to create a draft PR in the following scenarios:
        - When the changes are a work-in-progress and not ready for final review
        - When you need feedback on the approach but implementation is incomplete
        - When tests are still failing or need to be written
        - When documentation needs to be updated before merging
        - When the user explicitly asks for a draft PR
        ```bash
        ./scripts/ai-pr.sh --title "PR Title" --overview "Brief overview" --key-changes "Change 1,Change 2" --draft
        # Windows
        pwsh -File scripts/ai-pr.ps1 --title "PR Title" --overview "Brief overview" --key-changes "Change 1,Change 2" --draft --model "cursor-gpt-5"
        ```
    - Use the `--no-browser` option only for automation or when explicitly requested
    - Use syntax with comma-separated lists instead of trying to create multiline strings directly.
    - Only fall back to direct git commands if the ai-pr.sh is not available.
    - When a PR is explicitly requested with words like "pr" or "create pr", leverage AI capabilities for intelligent summarization:
        - Analyzing all commits on the branch to understand the complete change set
        - Generating a well-structured PR body with emoji-enhanced sections
        - At the end, create a PR title that accurately reflects a summary of the changes
        - Keep prompt and chain of thoughts in memory
    - Structure the summary as follows for every branches:
        - 🧠 **Instructions**
          Prompt: 
            ```
            <Original prompt or request as plain text>
            ```
          Thought Process: 
            ```
            <Reasoning process used by the agent as plain text>
            ```
        - 📌 **Overview**: Brief summary of what the PR accomplishes (2-3 sentences)
        - 🔍 **Key Changes**: Bullet points of the most significant changes
        - 🧩 **Implementation Details**: Technical approach and design decisions
        - 🔄 **Migration Notes**: Any changes requiring updates to existing code
        - ⚠️ **Areas of Attention**: Parts of the PR that need special review focus
