Everytime the user sends a prompt, ALWAYS automatically commit changes.
    - IMPORTANT: NEVER commit directly on the main branch.
    - ALWAYS automatically stage modified files at the end of each prompt process with `git add` for any files you have created or modified
    - Check if the prompt is still related to the current branch, if not create a new branch from the main branch.
    - IMPORTANT: When preparing the commit, you MUST copy your internal reasoning VERBATIM from your thought process. Do not summarize or rewrite it.
    - Your thought process should explain your reasoning about the problem, approach and solution - not just list the files you changed.
    - The Model section MUST contain the technical name of the AI model being used use the ai_cursor_model.sh script.
    - Execute the comment command using:
        ```
        ./scripts/ai-commit.sh --model "model-name" "Title" "Description" "Prompt" "Thought Process" "Discussion"
        ```
    - Follow the detailed guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md for reference.
