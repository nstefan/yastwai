# YASTWAI Project - Commit Rules & Standards

## CRITICAL COMMIT RULES
- NEVER commit directly to the main branch
- ALWAYS verify branch status BEFORE preparing a commit
- ONLY commit on feature branches

## Mandatory Branch Verification Before Commits
- Before initiating ANY commit operation, verify the current branch:
  - Unix/macOS: `./scripts/ai-protect-main.sh --no-auto-branch`
  - Windows: `pwsh -File scripts/ai-protect-main.ps1 --no-auto-branch`
- If on main branch, STOP and create a feature branch before proceeding:
  `./scripts/ai-protect-main.sh --auto-branch "descriptive-feature-name"`

## Commit Preparation
1. Check for staged changes:
   `git status --short | cat`

2. Choose ONE of these options based on what needs to be committed:
   - Stage all changes:
     `git add -A`
   - Stage specific files:
     `git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2`
   - Stage interactive changes (requires user interaction):
     `git add -p`

3. Verify what's staged:
   `git diff --cached --stat | cat`

## Commit Structure
- Use the ai-commit helpers for all commits:
  - Unix/macOS: `./scripts/ai-commit.sh --model "model-name" "Title" "Description" "Prompt" "Thoughts" "Discussion"`
  - Windows (PowerShell): `pwsh -File scripts/ai-commit.ps1 -Model "model-name" "Title" "Description" "Prompt" "Thoughts" "Discussion"`

- Commit message format must follow:
  - `type`: fix, feat, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
  - `scope`: indicates area of code affected (optional)
  - Message should be clear, concise, and descriptive

## Prohibited Commit Actions
- NEVER use raw `git commit` commands without the ai-commit.sh script
- NEVER force-push to any branch without explicit user instruction
- NEVER amend commits without explicit user instruction

## Commit Verification
- After completing a commit, verify it was successful:
  `git log -1 --stat | cat`
- Confirm the commit hash, message, and changes

Everytime the user sends a prompt, ALWAYS automatically commit changes, BUT ONLY AFTER strict branch validation.
    - CRITICAL: NEVER commit directly on the main branch under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
    - VALIDATION REQUIRED: Before ANY git operation, run './scripts/ai-branch.sh --check-only' to identify the current branch.
    - BRANCH CHECK: If current branch is 'main', IMMEDIATELY create a new feature branch before proceeding with ANY changes:
        ```bash
        ./scripts/ai-branch.sh --new-branch "feature-name" --is-related false
        ```
    - STOP AND ALERT: If working on main branch, use this exact message before taking any action:
        ```
        ⚠️ WARNING: Currently on main branch. Direct commits to main are prohibited. 
        Creating a new feature branch before proceeding...
        ```
    - ALWAYS automatically stage modified files at the end of each prompt process with `git add` for any files you have created or modified
    - Check if the prompt is still related to the current branch, if not create a new branch from the main branch.
    - IMPORTANT: When preparing the commit, you MUST copy your internal reasoning VERBATIM from your thought process. Do not summarize or rewrite it.
    - Your thought process should explain your reasoning about the problem, approach and solution - not just list the files you changed.
    - The Model section MUST contain the technical name of the AI model being used use the ai_cursor_model.sh script.
    - Execute the commit command using:
        ```
        ./scripts/ai-commit.sh --model "model-name" "Title" "Description" "Prompt" "Thought Process" "Discussion"
        ```
    - FINAL VALIDATION: After committing, verify you are NOT on the main branch with:
        ```bash
        ./scripts/ai-branch.sh --check-only
        ```
    - Follow the detailed guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md for reference.
